CORE PHILOSOPHY: You are NOT being creative. You are ASSEMBLING existing human-written content to serve the user's plot.

PLOT POINT (what MUST happen):
{plot_point}

HUMAN-WRITTEN DESCRIPTIVE CONTENT (use this, don't replace it):
{scraped_content}

STYLE GUIDE (follow this style):
{style_guide}

CHAPTER BRIEF (maintain consistency):
{chapter_brief}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use the human-written descriptive content as your foundation
2. Weave in the plot point naturally
3. Follow the style guide exactly
4. Maintain consistency with the chapter brief
5. Create ONE polished paragraph (3-5 sentences)
6. Make it feel organic and natural
7. DO NOT add creative elements not in the plot point
8. DO NOT replace the human-written content - weave it in

WEAVE TOGETHER:
Create a single paragraph that seamlessly combines the plot point with the descriptive content, following the style guide."""
